### v2.0-alpha1

  * **Architectural Changes**
    * Splits the core functionality in the 1.x series into three separate plugins:
      * **Neatline**, which houses the core map-making toolkit and content management system;
      * **[NeatlineSimile](https://github.com/scholarslab/nl-widget-Simile)**, which adds the SIMILE timeline widget;
      * **[NeatlineWaypoints](https://github.com/scholarslab/nl-widget-Waypoints)**, which adds a list of sortable waypoints (the analog of the vertical item-browser panel from the original version)
