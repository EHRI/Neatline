# Neatline Exhibits: An Overview

## At a glance

  - An exhibit is the "canvas" for a Neatline project, the environment in which the content is displayed.
  - Exhibit-level settings define basic, high-level defaults for the project (title, base layers, prose narrative, etc).
  - Each exhibit has its own editing environment, where you can create a collection of records (the contents of the exhibit).
  - Likewise, each exhibit has its a separate page on the public-facing version of the website.
  - Each installation of Neatline can contain an indefinite number of exhibits.

## What is a Neatline exhibit?

Each project built with Neatline will have its own exhibit, which can be thought of as the "canvas" or "environment" for the project - the set of base maps or images on top of which the content is displayed, the text narrative that introduces or describes the project, and the configuration of user-interface widgets and components that are enabled for the project (timelines, lists of waypoints, etc).

These high-level configuration options are defined using the "Exhibit Settings" form, which is used to both create new exhibits and edit existing exhibits:

Once an exhibit has been created and configured, you can add content to the exhibit by opening the editing environment for the exhibit (generally just called "the editor"), a specialized, interactive map-making application that makes it possible to create and manipulate a collection of records, which make up the actual content of the exhibit:

Almost all of the real work happens in the editor. You might spend 30-40 seconds in the "Exhibit Settings" form, and 30-40 days building content for the exhibit in the editing environment.
