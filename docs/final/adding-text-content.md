# Adding Text Content

## At a Glance

  - Text annotation about a record is stored in the "Title" and "Body" fields.
  - The title should generally be short and to-the-point.
  - The body is a catch-all field that can contain everything from short blurbs up to long-format prose.
  - The body can also contain any kind of content that can be embedded in HTML - audio, video, etc.
  - The "Slug" field is a plain-text identifier that can be used to reference the record from the exhibit narrative.
