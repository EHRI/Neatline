# Adding Text Content

## At a Glance

  - Text content for records is entered in the "Title" and "Body" fields in the "Text" tab.
  - The title should be short, and generally shouldn't contain complex HTML or formatting.
  - The body can be anything from a short blurb up to a long-format narrative essay.
  - Any kind of HTML-embeddable media can be put in the body - audio, video, etc.
  - Use the "Edit HTML" links to open a fullscreen WYSWYG editor for either of the fields.
