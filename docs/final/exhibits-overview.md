# Neatline Exhibits: An Overview

## At a Glance

- A group of items to be displayed together by Neatline are gathered into an
**Exhibit**.

- An exhibit allows you to filter items, group them, and display how and when
they'll be displayed.

## What is a Neatline Exhibit?

Neatline groups sets of items for display as exhibits. Exhibits allow you to
manage all of its facets:

- Its widgets (for example,
[Waypoints](https://github.com/scholarslab/nl-widget-Waypoints) and
[Simile](https://github.com/scholarslab/nl-widget-Simile));

- Its items and when and how they're displayed;

- Its styles and how items are displayed on the map, both individually and in
concert.

Using Neatline starts with creating an exhibit, and you'll spend most of your
time editing exhibits' contents and styles.
