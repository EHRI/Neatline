# Neatline from 10,000 Meters

## At a Glance

  - Neatline is built as a set of plugins for Omeka.
  - Omeka is a web publishing framework that makes it easy to create collections of standards-compliant metadata records - sort of like Wordpress or Drupal, but designed for scholars and archivists.
  - Omeka is a web application that can be installed either on a public-facing web server or on a local development environment on your own computer.
  - Neatline can be used out-of-the-box with modern-geography base layers (eg, OpenStreetMap or Google layers).
  - If you want to overlay historical maps or create custom base layers, you'll need to host the imagery using a separate piece of software called Geoserver.
