# Neatline from 10,000 Meters

**At a glance:**

  - Neatline is built as a collection of plugins for Omeka.
  - Omeka is a web publishing framework that makes it easy to create collections of standards-compliant metadata records - like Wordpress or Drupal, but designed for scholars and archivists.
  - Omeka is a web application written using PHP and MySQL. You can install it either on a public-facing web host, or on a local server on your computer.
  - Neatline can be used out-of-the-box with modern-geography base layers (eg, Google maps). If you want to overlay historical maps or create custom base layers, you'll need to host the maps using a piece of software called Geoserver.
