# Preparing to Install

## At a Glance

  - To run Omeka and Neatline, you'll need a "LAMP stack" server - **L**inux, **A**pache, **M**ySQL, and **P**HP.
  - This is a really common technology stack that's supported by almost any commercial webhost.
  - If you just want to experiment with Neatline, you can install it on your own computer using a sandbox environment.
  - Geoserver is a Java application that has different hosting requirements.
  - You can either run your own installation of Geoserver or purchase hosting from a commercial provider.
