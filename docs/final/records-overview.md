# Records Overview

## At a Glance

  - Everything in a Neatline exhibit is represented as a "record."
  - There are two basic types of records - records that are associated with items in the underlying Omeka collection, and records that exist just in the context of an individual Neatline exhibit.
  - Records are displayed in different ways depending on what kind of information they contain - they could be vector annotations on the map, overlayed historical layers, points on a timeline, or clickable waypoints.
  - The same record can appear in multiple places - it could have a point on the map and a point on the timeline.
