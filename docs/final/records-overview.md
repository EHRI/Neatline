# Records Overview

## At a Glance

  - Everything in a Neatline exhibit is represented as a "record."
  - There are two basic types of records - records that are associated with items in the underlying Omeka collection, and records that exist just in the context of a single Neatline exhibit.
  - Records are displayed in different ways depending on the type of information they contain - a record could be a vector annotation on the map, an overlayed historical layer, a plotting on a timeline, or a clickable waypoint.
  - The same record can appear in multiple places in an exhibit.
