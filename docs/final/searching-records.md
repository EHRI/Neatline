# Searching for Records

## At a Glance

  - Use the forward and backward arrows to page through the records.
  - Enter plain-text queries to search in the "Title," "Body," and "Slug" fields.
  - Type `tags: <tag1>, <tag2>, ...` to search by tags.
  - Type `map:` to make the record list mirror the currently-visible records on the map.
  - Clear the search box to show all records.

When there are just a handful of records in an exhibit, it's easy to keep track of everything. But what if there are 1,000 records, or 100,000? In Neatline 2.0, it's possible to work with _really_ large collections of records - as many as about 1,000,000 in a single exhibit. If the ehxibit can display that quantity of information, though, there need to be tools to effectively manage information at that scale. To help with this, Neatline provides some useful searching and filtering tools tools that make it easy to hone in on the content that you're interested in working with.

## Pagination Buttons

To make it easier to browse through the content of an exhibit, Neatline splits apart large collections of records into a series of "pages," each containing a fixed number of records (by default, 50). When you first start building an exhibit, the pagination buttons will be hidden, since there aren't enough records yet to spill over onto a second page. As soon as you go over the paging limit, though, you'll see the forward and backwards buttons to page back and forth through the content.

As you click through to different pages, notice that the URL updates 

## Fulltext Search

To find records by regular, plain-text search queries, just enter search terms into the "Search" box at the top of the content management pane in the editor. As you type, Neatline will immediately query the underlying collection and update the list with the set of matching records. When you're finished searching, just clear out the search box to go back to regular, unfiltered list of records.
