# Editing Record Colors

## Fill Color

The color used in the "body" a polygon - the area inside of the lines, not including the lines themselves. The fill color also functions as the default color for the record in other contexts. For example, if the record is plotted on the SIMILE Timeline widget, the fill color is used to set the color of the point or span that represents the record on the timeline. Think of the fill color as the "main" color for the record.

## Fill Color (Selected)

The color used in the "body" of a polygon when the record is highlighted or selected (for example, when the cursor hovers or clicks on the record). In many cases, it looks nice to set the "Fill Color" and the "Selected Fill Color" to the same value, and use the opacity settings to distinguish between the regular and selected states of the record. In other cases, though, when you want a more pronounced distinction, it can make sense to set a separate color for the selected state.

## Stroke Color

The color of the lines that run around the edges of a shape.

## Stroke Color (Selected)

The color of the lines that run around the edges of a shape when the record is highlighted or selected (for example, when the cursor hovers or clicks on the record).
