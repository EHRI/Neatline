# Editing Record Colors

## Fill Color

The Fill Color is the color used to represent the "body" a polygon - the area inside of the lines, not including the lines themselves. The fill color also functions as the default color for the record in other contexts. For example, if the record is plotted on the SIMILE Timeline widget, the fill color is used to set the color of the point or span that represents the record on the timeline. Think of the fill color as the "main" color for the record.

## Fill Color (Selected)

The "Selected Fill Color" is used to represent the "body" of a polygon when the cursor hovers or clicks on the record. In many cases, it looks nice to set the "Fill Color" and the "Selected Fill Color" to the same value, and use the opacity settings to distinguish between the regular and selected states of the record. In other cases, though, when you want a more pronounced distinction, it can make sense to set a separate color for the selected state.

## Stroke Color

The "Stroke Color" determines the color of the lines that run around the edges of a shape.

## Stroke Color (Selected)

"Stroke Color (Selected)" determines the color of the lines that run around the edges of a shape when the cursor hovers or clicks on the record.
