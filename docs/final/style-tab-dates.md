# Editing Record Dates

## At a Glance

  - These fields describe when a record "occurred," or when the record should be visible in the exhibit.
  - **Important**: All dates must be entered in a portable, standards-compliant format called [ISO 8601][iso8601].
  - To display temporal information, you'll need to install a sub-plugin like [NeatlineSimile][neatline-simile].

### Examples:

  - `1564` - The year 1564.
  - `1564-04` - April, 1564.
  - `1564-04-23` - April 23, 1564.
  - `1564-04-23T08:30` - 8:30 AM on April 23, 1564.
  - `1564-04-23T08:30:15` - 15 seconds after 8:30 AM on April 23, 1564.
