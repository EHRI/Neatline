## At a Glance

  - These fields describe when an event represented by a record occurred, or when the record should be visible in the exhibit.
  - **Important**: All dates must be entered in a standardized format called [ISO 8601][iso8601].
  - To display date information, you'll need to install a sub-plugin like NeatlineSimile.
