# Editing Record Dates

## At a Glance

  - These fields describe when a record "occurred," or when the record should be visible in the exhibit.
  - **Important**: All dates must be entered in a portable, standards-compliant format called [ISO 8601][iso8601].
  - To display temporal information, you'll need to install a sub-plugin like [NeatlineSimile][neatline-simile].
