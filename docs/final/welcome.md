# Welcome to Neatline!

This guide is designed to be a comprehensive introduction to the Neatline project. We'll walk through the basic steps of installing and configuring Neatline, creating exhibits and records, importing items from your Omeka collection, and publishing your projects to the web. Toward the end, we'll also discuss some more advanced and techniques that can be used to modify Neatline's built-in feature set - adding custom base layers, creating custom themes for individual exhibits, and using a Neatline-flavored dialect of CSS to manage large collections of geospatial information.
