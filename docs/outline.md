# Working with Exhbits

## Exhibits Overview
Exhibits are like the "canvas" for a project.

## Creating New Exhibits
Click "Create an Exhibit". Field A does B, field X does Y, etc.

## Managing Exhibits
The browse view lists existing exhibits. Click the title to open the Neatline editor, "Exhibit Settings" to global settings, etc.

# Working with Records

## Records Overview
Records are the content inside of an exhibit, the paint on the canvas. There are two kinds of records - records that are associated with Omeka items, and exhibit-specifc records that just exist in the context of one exhibit.

## Creating new Records
Click "New Record", etc.

## Adding Text Content
"Text" tab - "Title" does X, "Body" does Y, "Slug" does Z, etc.

## Adding Vector Geometry
"Map" tab - Draw points, lines, polygons by doing X, Y, Z, etc.

## Editing Visual Styles
"Style" tab - Change colors, opacities, etc.

## Searching Records
Run fulltext searches by typing in the "Search" box, use pagination, etc.

## Bulk-Updating with Stylesheets
Perform bulk-updates with Neatline-flavored CSS.

## Importing Items from Omeka
Can associate individual record with Omeka item, or bulk-import large numbers of items at once.
