## Adding Vector Geometry
"Map" tab - Draw points, lines, polygons by doing X, Y, Z, etc.

## Editing Visual Styles
"Style" tab - Change colors, opacities, etc.

## Searching Records
Run fulltext searches by typing in the "Search" box, use pagination, etc.

## Bulk-Updating with Stylesheets
Perform bulk-updates with Neatline-flavored CSS.

## Importing Items from Omeka
