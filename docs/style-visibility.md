5. In the *Max Zoom* field, specify the maximum zoom level at which the record will be visible â€“ note that this integer must be greater than or equal to the *Min Zoom* value. To select the current zoom level, click the **Use Current** text.

6. In the *Default Focus* field, manually enter the geometry for your desired default map focus.
