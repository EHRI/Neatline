## Welcome to Neatline!

This guide is designed to be a comprehensive introduction to the Neatline project. We'll walk through the basic steps of installing and configuring Neatline, creating exhibits and records, importing items from your Omeka collection, and publishing your projects to the web. Towards the end, we'll also discuss some more advanced workflows and techniques that can be used to modify Neatline's build-in feature set - adding custom base layers, creating custom themes for individual exhibits, and using a Neatline-flavored dialect of CSS to manage large collections of geospatial information.

### What is Neatline?

In the broadest sense, Neatline is an annotation framework  that makes it possible to create rich, interactive editions of visual objects. In the past, the project has focused on geospatial materials - maps, essentially - but Neatline can also be used to annotate anything that has some sort of two-dimensional, visual instantiation. The same set of vector-drawing and content management tools can be used to to mark up maps can also be used to create interpretive views of paintings, drawings, photographs, documents, diagrams, and anything else that can be captured as an image.

### What Makes it Different?

How does Neatline fit into the existing ecosystem of geospatial and annotation tools? Neatline sits somewhere in the space between consumer-web mapping applications like the Google custom map maker and heavyweight GIS tools like ArcGIS. It's designed to be simple enough that college undergradutes can easily use it for class assignments, but also sufficiently flexible, scalable, and feature-rich that it can be used for professional scholarship, journalism, and art. Neatline keeps things simple and provides sensible defaults, but it's careful never to make aesthetic or intellectual decisions on your behalf.
