<h3>Add Tags To Records</h3>

**Required Fields:** none <br/>
**Recommended Best Practice:** Establish the tagging you will use for the entire project before beginning to tag individual records.

1. In the Neatline editor, click **New record** or select an existing record.

2. Click the **Style** button in the record editor.

3. In the *Tags* field enter a tag identifier for the record you are editing.

4. To apply more tags to the record, place the additional terms in the same *Tags* field and use a comma to separate the values.
